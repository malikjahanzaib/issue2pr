We've included a Python script for processing and analyzing data from a CSV file. Here's how you can use it:
1. The script is located in the `data_processing` directory.
2. You can run the script with the command `python data_processing.py`.
3. The script will read data from a CSV file, perform basic statistical analysis, and generate a summary report.
4. By default, the script will read from a file named `data.csv` in the same directory and write to a file named `summary_report.txt`. You can change these values by passing arguments to the `main` function.
In this example, the script will read data from `your_data.csv` and write the report to `your_report.txt`.
Please note that the script performs error handling and logging. If an error occurs, it will be logged to a file named `data_processing.log` in the same directory.
